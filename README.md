Impact of SEC the decision on Bitcoin transactions network

The US financial markets watchdog, the SEC, gave the go-ahead on Wednesday for the listing of a new bitcoin investment product, a decision seen as a major step towards the adoption of cryptocurrencies, which could shake up the sector. The aim of our work is to analyze the impact of the Security Exchange Comission's 10/10/2024 announcements (SEC decision) on bitcoin transactions.

The SEC, the US financial markets watchdog, has given the go-ahead for the listing of an ETF (exchange traded fund), an index fund that enables investors to profit from bitcoin's developments without investing their money directly in the digital currency. In concrete terms, investors buy shares in the fund, which they can sell at any time, rather than bitcoin. The fund's assets are invested in cryptocurrencies.

The market had already reached a milestone, in October 2021, with the listing of the first ETF invested not directly in bitcoin but in futures contracts linked to the cryptocurrency. Until now, access to digital currencies required opening an account on a cryptocurrency exchange platform and converting a traditional currency (issued by a central bank), such as the dollar.

By accepting the application of 11 investment companies, including BlackRock, the SEC has authorised a new bitcoin investment product. This is a major step forward for the adoption of cryptocurrencies, which could revolutionise the industry. This approval could "attract a significant amount of capital to the sector and is expected to have a potentially massive impact on valuations across the entire cryptocurrency sector", Swissquote analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya.

Many investors had anticipated this authorisation. Over the last twelve months, the price of the leading cryptocurrency by capitalisation has soared by more than 150%. Bitcoin is now worth more than 45,000 dollars. In an uncertain geopolitical climate, some investors are also tending to turn to cryptoassets - which are reputed to be volatile - as a safe haven, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently said.
